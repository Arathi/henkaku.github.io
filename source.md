We plan to open source the entire project at some point. For now, parts have been open sourced.

  * [VitaShell](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/VitaShell) is maintained by The_FloW and is re-branded as molecularShell with permission.
  * This [site](https://github.com/henkaku/henkaku.github.io) is hosted on Github Pages and the licensing information is in the footer.
  * The dynamic installer is released for [self hosting](https://github.com/henkaku/henkaku/releases/latest) as a Go server.
  * The WebKit exploit as a [ROP chain](https://github.com/henkaku/henkaku/tree/stage-2).

We also have technical documentation of the exploits used.

  * The initial [WebKit exploit](https://blog.xyz.is/2016/webkit-360.html)
  * The [offline payload](https://blog.xyz.is/2016/henkaku-offline-installer.html)
  * The [kernel exploit](https://blog.xyz.is/2016/vita-netps-ioctl.html)

Finally, we [challenge worthy hackers](http://yifan.lu/2016/08/05/henkaku-koth-challenge/) to reverse the rest of the exploit. We open-source each component as soon as it has been reversed.
