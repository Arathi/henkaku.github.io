Privacy Policy
===============================================================================
HENkaku runs code on your PS Vita device through an exploit in the browser. This technique is usually used by malicious applications to steal personal information therefore we want to be very clear in this: we do not run any code on your device without your explicit consent in pressing the "Install" button and then pressing it again. Our server blocks any attempt to bypass this in case a third party wishes to use our site to install HENkaku on someone else's device (called clickjacking). We also make sure that any attempts to load HENkaku on an incompatible Vita or onto another device will be blocks. This ensures that our site cannot be used in a denial-of-service attack by crashing people's browsers.

Please note that all of the following only applies to the HENkaku installer. Be aware of what homebrews you install in case malicious ones pop up. Also be aware that third parties can re-purpose our code for more nefarious means. If you do not want to be exposed to that risk, we recommend that you do not use the PS Vita web browser for any purpose other than installing HENkaku (from our HTTPS site).

## Personal Information
There are personal information and unique identifiers on your Vita. We do not store any identifying information and we do not transmit them over the network either. In the beginning of the installation, we do transmit some data corresponding to the current state of your device's firmware. This state does not contain any personal/identifying information and is required for our server to generate a unique install package for the current state of your device. This is required because PS Vita's security features prevents generic payloads from running on your device.

## Cookies and Tracking
We use [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-policy/) and [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/) to run our website. We also use [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en). We do not use cookies or tracking beyond that.

## Other Information
We do not keep any other information about you and we do not know who installed our software beyond records of incoming IP addresses.
